# Munchies

A group project to create an app that combines  two things that typically go well together:  Cannabis and takeout food!

Users input an address, and using the Google Places API and the Eat Street API, the app returns all dispensaries within a 10 mile radius, along with food options. Users are able to, through the Eat Street API, directly order food.

## Technologies involved

Munchies was creating using several technologies, including Firebase (for authentication and age verification), the EatStreet API, Google Places API, AJAX, jQuery, Javascript, CSS3, HTML5, Symantic UI, and Moment.js.

Future development ideas include a more robust dispensary locator (along with more information on dispensaries - ordering online, menus, etc) and including, local, state, and federal laws allowing, delivery options ala Uber Eats.
